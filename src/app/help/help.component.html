                           SAGE is played with two or more people, with one person
                           being the host and the other(s) playing the game.
                       </li>
                        <li>
                            The point of the game is for the player(s) to guess what the definition of a word is on a card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each word has four hints: a synonym, an antonymn, a general sense and an example usage.
                            A player may use a hint to help them guess the definition by pressing the hint button on the card, but the hints are random.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each card starts with 5 points. Each time a hint is used, a point is deducted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the player(s) don't guess the definition correctly, move on to the next card. If they guess correctly, press the "Got it!" button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have fun!
                        </li>
